# A message from @lebao3105
Hello everyone!

It's a long time since my last GitHub page, built on top of Jenkyll. Now I'm back with another web-gen engine - [Pelican](docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/quickstart.html)!

Writing contents for this website will be different from the past - let's take a look:
```
|__ content # Where I put my pages
    |__ blog # Blog
    |__ tutorial # Tutorials
    |__ updates # Updates, should I merge it with blog?
|__ output # Pages generated by Pelican
```

Everything will be published to ```lebao3105.github.io``` as usual.

# One more thing...
I don't have much to say - because of my English isn't good enough, and my \*explanion* skill too (everyone can see it). There also will be some logic bugs somewhere.

If you found it, you can notify me via email/Twitter, or GitHub Issues. This helps me a lot!

And finally... thank you guys a lot for viewing/reading my website! Have a good dayðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—!
