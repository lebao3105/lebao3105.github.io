    <h1>New status of the texteditor project (with Tkinter)</h1>
    
    <h4>What happened?</h4>
    <p>
        <code class="inline-code">texteditor</code> has started using wxPython at the end of 2022.

        <a href="https://wxPython.org">wxPython</a> is the Python binding of <a href="https://wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> -
        a GUI toolkit which brings us the native OS's look (since wxWidgets is the binding of the OS's native/choosen GUI), plus some handmade things.

        This marks my higher step in my programming skill, with more organized, optimized code.
    </p>

    <h4>How about Tkinter? And what's next?</h4>
    <p>
        Tkinter UI is ugly in non-Windows/macOS, due to how Tcl that Tkinter based on - works. However it's much more better at customizing the interface than wx*.
        <br>
        However, wx still has so many goods than Tkinter, also easier to do basic things like bind events, place things.
        <br>
        Texteditor (now Textworker) will stop using Tkinter after the ongoing 1.5 release.
        <br>
        I really can't work on 2 different versions of a project like that. Porting new changegs together? We have <code>libtextworker</code> and
        <a href="https://gitlab.com/textworker/Assets">Assets</a> repo.
        <br>
        Tkinter is the first thing people think about when they start making their first GUI Python apps. It's fast, easy to learn and use... And most people use Windows - where Tcl doesn't have issues about.
