        Hi and welcome to lebao3105.github.io!<br>
        This is the front page of the site, tells about me and my contents here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm Le Bao Nguyen (Nguyen is the last name), a student+developer from Viet Nam.
        <br>
        I was born at 2008. Let's say once again: I'm a Communist Vietnam citizen;)
        <br>
        <small>4/30 is coming - it's a day that pisses some people off. But we all prefer to not have the entire country split like the Koreans.</small>
        <br>
        I like technology and music, plus games.
    </p>

    <p>
        So what do we have here?
    </p>

    <p>
        Tutorials, announcements and my own opinion about things.<br>
        My associated projects are here too.<br>
        Also my normal life things. Sort of?

        <ul>
            <li>Tutorials can be found <a href="tutorials.html">here.</a></li>
            <li>Updates can be found <a href="updates.html">here.</a></li>
            <li>Also my associated <a href="projects.html">projects.</a></li>
            <li>Here goes my blog <a href="blog.html">posts.</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        There are so many things need to be completed for this website... RSS is an example.<br>
        If you found any weird things, you can notify me via <a href="https://x.com/lebao_roofs">Twitter</a> (no DM on Twitter), or the repository's issues <a href="https://github.com/lebao3105.github.io/issues">tracker</a>. This helps me a lot!
    </p>
