        Hi and welcome to lebao3105.github.io!<br>
        This is the first page of the site, covers about me and my contents here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm Le Bao Nguyen (Nguyen is the last name), a 16 y/o student+developer from Viet Nam.<br>

        Just a normal people, though. I like technology and music, plus games and some more stuff.
    </p>

    <p>So what do we have here?</p>
    <p>Tutorials, announcements and my own opinion about things.
       Also my normal life things. Sort of?
    </p>

        </ul>
    </p>
