    <p>
        Hi and welcome to lebao3105.github.io!<br>
        This is the first page of the site, covers about me and my contents here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm Le Bao Nguyen (Nguyen is the last name), a student+developer from Viet Nam.
        <br>
        I was born at 2008.
        <br>
        I like technology and music, plus games.
    </p>

    <p>So what do we have here?</p>
    <p>Tutorials, announcements and my own opinion about things.
       My associated projects are here too.
       Also my normal life things. Sort of?

       <ul>
           <li>Tutorials can be found <a href=content/tutorials.html">here.</a></li>
           <li>Updates can be found <a href="content/updates.html">here.</a></li>
           <li>Also my associated <a href="content/projects.html">projects.</a></li>
       </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        There are so many things need to be completed for this website... RSS is an example.<br>
        If you found any weird things, you can notify me via email/Twitter (on Twitter no DM please), or GitHub Issues. This helps me a lot!
