        Hi and welcome to lebao3105.github.io!<br>
        This is the front page of the site, tells about me and my contents here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm Le Bao Nguyen (Nguyen is the last name), a student+developer from Viet Nam.
        <br>
        I was born in 2008.
        <br>
        I like technology, music, and sometimes writing stuff to keep this page alive (while nobody even knows this exists).
        <br>
        My (contributed) softwares are normally not something too big, or never reaches to its finish stage because of me developing it <bold>alone</bold>.
        <br>
        There is no main language here. I work on many language, some have their own version that are fine, some however do not.
        Pretty much that I'm struggling here. You'll see some of my projects using the link below.
    </p>

    <p>
        So what do we have here?
    </p>

    <p>
        Tutorials, announcements and my own opinion about things.<br>
        My associated projects are here too.<br>
        Also some other stuff? I don't know.

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The page is initially complete after times of rewriting. However this is not bug-free.<br>
        If you found any weird things, you can notify me via the repository's issues <a href="https://github.com/lebao3105/lebao3105.github.io/issues">tracker</a>.<br>
