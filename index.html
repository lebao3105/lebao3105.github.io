    <h1>welcome+about me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi and welcome to lebao3105.github.io!<br>
        This website has many things about technology, normal life etc. Tutorials exist too.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm Le Bao Nguyen (Nguyen is the last name), a student+developer from Viet Nam.<br>
        I'm 16 this year, born in Ha Noi.<br>

        Probably I can just tell you to open my GitHub profile and read what do you see, but no. Let me introduce myself (once again):

        <ul>
            <li>I have my own interests in technology things, e.g operating systems (OSes), programming languages, hardware.</li>
            <li>I also like to learn things new not only in technology scope!</li>
            <li>Music is a friend:-)</li>
            <li>I'm still too young to have a full opinion about politics, don't ask me anything about that. I will keep myself not far from the truth.</li>
            <li>I don't like how 3D take over our life. Or more accurate, how people abuse 3D: Reddit logo is an example. Also Microsoft products (Windows is only fine with a bunch of patches in order to now slow)</li>
            <li>I don't do much sports though...</li>
            <li>And why I use dotted list like that?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>So what do we have here?</p>
    <p>Not only things I have said above (the very first paragraph), but if you look at my GitHub + GitLab, there are many projects I think you may be interested in!
        For example:
        <ul>
            <li>TextWorker: A text editor that I want to make it an expandable IDE. Almost 3 years for it to be... rewritten in C++.</li>
            <li>FPOS: The Free Pascal Operating System. I just have been invited to the development. No actual work from now except the next project I will tell you.</li>
            <li>FPSH: Free Pascal Shell. This is NOT an interperter, mainly made for FPOS but you can use it in your OS.</li>
            <li>And many more, from open to archived.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Hard coded page links:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="content/tutorials/wxWidgets_WindowsCmake.html">How to install wxWidgets on Windows with CMake</a></li>
            <li><a href="content/updates/duckstation.html">The first build of DuckStation is out (it's a year since that lol)</a></li>
            <li><a href="content/updates/texteditor_tk_update.html">Tkinter deprecation in TextWorker</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        There are so many things need to be completed for this website... RSS is an example.<br>
        If you found any weird things, you can notify me via email/Twitter (on Twitter no DM please), or GitHub Issues. This helps me a lot!
        <br>
        And finally... thank you guys a lot for viewing/reading my website! Have a good dayðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—!
    </p>
